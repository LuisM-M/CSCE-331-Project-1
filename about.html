        <p> ABOUT ME </p> 
        <p>    My name is Luis Martinez Morales, I am a Junior Computer Science Student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. I was born in Mexico City, Mexico where I lived for about 6 years. In Mexico I learned to speak and read basic Spanish and I was surrounded by my entire family. I moved to Sturbridge, Massachusetts in the Summer before I started Kindergarten and that was a very big change for me. I had to start reading and writing in English in a foreign place with only my close family to support me.</p>
        <p>    I stayed in Massachusetts for 7 long years. Massachusetts was not a big melting pot like New York so it was hard to keep speaking Spanish and maintain my culture but I persevered. I learned to read and write in English. I learned to express myself and get assimilated with American culture. I got to experience snow, hail, and even a tornado at some point.</p>
        <p>    Finally, when I finished 7th grade, my family moved to Texas. This was another big change in my life, I left all of my childhood friends behind and went on a new adventure. When I arrived in Texas everything once again changed. But this time, I was surrounded by a large Hispanic community. It was the perfect mix of American culture and Mexican culture. I could go to the store and find all of the food that I had missed from Mexico. I could speak Spanish with strangers and practice my Spanish. In Austin, I found long lasting friendships and people to support me and my dreams.</p>
        <p>    In high school I found out that I wanted to study Computer Science like my dad. I enrolled in Computer Science courses every year and I even competed in Computer Science UIL. I applied to many internships and conferences. I interned at Cloudera which has an office in downtown Austin. I interned at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> the Summer before my senior year. I traveled to both Boston, Massachusetts and San Diego, California to attend some seminars. I found confidence and I started to realize that I could do what I set my mind to.</p>
        <p>    Now, I am here in College Station, Texas. Where I am a part of a few organizations on campus. I love to stay involved and create a welcoming community for my peers.</p>
