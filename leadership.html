        <a href="https://github.com/LuisM-M/CyberAttackPrediction">CYBER ATTACK PREDICTOR</a> <br> <br>
        <p>I worked on a team with Anna Huang and Citlali Haro Franco, under the guidance of our mentor: Sean Crawford. We set out to find the correlation between the type of Cyber Attack that affect the US and the time of year in which they happen.</p>
        <p>This was a project for the <a href="https://ai-4-all.org/">AI4ALL</a> program during the Summer of 2021. </p>

        <p>I worked on a team with Anna Huang, Eric Nunes, and AKhil Mathew. Our goal was to create a Python proram that could calulate the area of any shape.</p>
        <p>This project was done during the <a href="https://tamuhack.com/">TAMU HACK</a> event in 2021.  </p>
